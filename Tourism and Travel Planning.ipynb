      "When I’m out and about with my camera in a dream location, and everywhere I look there are photo opportunities galore, the light is perfect, my heart is racing with the thrill… well it really doesn’t get any better than that!\n",
      "So when I’m researching my next trip, I’m always looking for incredible places to travel for photography.\n",
      "Where has the most stunning architecture, the most unique culture, the most colourful characters?\n",
      "Where has abundant wildlife or incredible landscapes? Where is safe enough to wander with a camera; where has the friendliest people who’ll let me take their portrait?\n",
      "Myanmar is a great place to travel if you enjoy photographing colourful characters\n",
      "Now, having travelled to over 70 countries and photographed in many of the world’s most celebrated travel photography destinations, I thought I’d make a list of the very best ones. Click the links within each section to take you to some of the images I shot there.\n",
      "Of course, there are still plenty more I haven’t had the chance to visit yet. So just in case I’d missed a few gems off my travel photography bucket list, I reached out to some fellow travel experts and asked them to report back on what they think is the top place to travel for photographers.\n",
      "This is by no means an exhaustive list, and I’m sure there are loads of wonderfully photogenic places I’ve missed. But there are certainly some stunning travel photography destinations in here, and I hope that within this list, you’ll find plenty of inspiration for your next travel photography trip!\n",
      "Top places to visit for travel photography\n",
      "1/ The icy landscapes of Antarctica\n",
      "There’s a reason why Antarctica is right at the top of most travel photographers’ bucket lists. With its gorgeous icy landscapes, mirror-calm bays, majestic glaciers, icebergs the size of houses, and clear wintry light, it’s landscape photography heaven. In fact it’s virtually impossible to take a bad photo here!\n",
      "And that’s before you even consider the wildlife – with six species of seals and eight types of penguins , not to mention whales and seabirds, Antarctica has everything to offer the passionate wildlife photographer too.\n",

      "It’s not easy to get there, and it isn’t cheap either, so a trip to Antarctica is probably a once-in-a-lifetime, bucket list pick for most travel photographers. Only problem is: once you’ve been there, you just want to go back!\n",

      "2/ Eye-catching street photography in Cuba\n",
      "If street photography is more your thing, then look no further than Cuba. Neglected by the Castro regime and battered by the US embargo that prevented any modernisation, Cuba has been effectively locked in a time warp for decades. But while this has been terrible for the country and its people in many ways, there’s no denying that it has made Cuba a dream destination for travel photographers.\n",
      "Wander the Cuban city streets in Havana and Trinidad and you’ll be spoilt for photography choice, with colourful historic buildings at every turn. Get lost down alleyways and side roads, delighting in the crumbling paintwork, the ornate wrought-iron decorations, and the brightly-painted shutters that cheerily hide the dilapidation within. Smile at the friendly Cuban people, who welcome visitors and don’t seem to mind having their photos taken.\n",
      "And then of course there are the famous Cuban cars , which roll the streets like living antiques. If you’re anything like me you can easily while away many hours photographing them from every angle, even missing dinner! Which is no great loss, because the food in Cuba is pretty terrible – but it’s a small price to pay for all the stunning photos you’ll bring home.\n",
      "Read more: Ethical Travel Photography: How To Capture With A Conscience\n",
      "Havana is filled with colourful buildings and classic cars, making it a brilliant place for travel photography\n",
      "3/ Myanmar: the world’s friendliest people\n",
      "Myanmar was on my travel photography bucket list for the longest time. And when I finally went there, I was not disappointed. Everywhere you go there are endless delights, from the golden glinting Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, to the ancient temples at Bagan , to the impossibly photogenic leg-rowing fishermen of Inle Lake , to the bustling markets .\n",
      "But the thing I loved best about travel photography in Myanmar was the people. Not only do they look fabulous, from the colourful street vendors to the red-robed Buddhist monks , but they were among the most friendly people I’ve ever met. Because Myanmar was closed to tourism for so long, its people are still just really happy to have visitors, and it shows in their generous and warm welcome. I don’t think a single person said no to me taking their photo!\n",
      "Sadly the political situation in Myanmar has deteriorated since I was there and some areas are not safe to visit. So you may need to think carefully about if and when to go, but if you do get the chance, I don’t think you’ll regret it!\n",

      "4/ The colours of Guatemala\n",
      "There aren’t all that many countries left in the world where the culture and way of life still seems very little changed by the unstoppable rush of modernity – but Guatemala is one of them.\n",
      "Guatemala is bursting with colourful towns , dramatic landscapes, and ancient cultural treasures . Lush rainforests, towering volcanoes exploding into the sky , and shimmering turquoise lakes provide stunning backdrops for your shots.\n",
      "Step back in time with captivating Mayan ruins like Tikal, where towering temples pierce the jungle canopy. Capture the energy of vibrant markets overflowing with handcrafted textiles and fresh produce. Antigua, a UNESCO World Heritage Site , offers charming cobblestone streets, pastel-painted colonial buildings, and majestic volcanoes as a backdrop.\n",
      "Beyond the scenery, Guatemala’s heart lies in its people. Photograph the smiles of indigenous communities dressed in traditional clothing (though you’ll need to be respectful and ask permission first, as many local people don’t like having their picture taken).\n",
      "While you may be worried about safety in Guatemala , as long as you take sensible precautions, you should be fine. I spent 3 months exploring this amazing country with my camera, and came back with some of the best photos of my life .\n",

      "5/ Glaciers and Northern Lights in Iceland\n",
      "For landscape photographers, there are few better places to travel than Iceland. Whether you go in summer or winter, or any time in between, there are endless opportunities for gorgeous photos of snow-capped mountains, thundering waterfalls , crashing waves, black sand beaches, calving glaciers and icy lagoons.\n",
      "Drive the ring road along the south coast and a journey of two hours will end up taking four as you stop endlessly for photos. Don’t miss the chance to walk inside a glacier ice cave, hike on a glacier , photograph fearsome sneaker waves , or admire the adorable Icelandic horses .\n",
      "And then of course there are the legendary Northern Lights . Take a Northern Lights tour from Reykjavik and if you’re lucky with the timing and the weather, you can turn your already epic Iceland photos into something you’ll be showing off for the rest of your life.\n",

      "6/ The souks and medinas of Morocco\n",
      "Like many of the countries on this list, Morocco doesn’t have just one thing to offer the enthusiastic travel photographer. You’ll have heard of the famous blue city of Chefchaouen , for example, which is certainly photogenic (if a little overrun with Instagrammers). Or the dramatic beauty of the Atlas mountains, or the rolling dunes and clear starry skies of the Sahara Desert .\n",
      "But for travel photography , the part I loved best were the twisty alleyways and colourful stalls of the medinas in Fes and Marrakech. These atmospheric mazes of streets and shops are easy to get lost in, but that’s part of the joy: no matter where you wander you’ll stumble across fascinating people and things to point your camera at.\n",
      "You’ll need to be sensitive, as many of the shoppers and traders don’t like having their photos taken, but if you’re subtle and respectful, you’ll come home with striking and unique images. Don’t miss the striking Chouara Tannery inside Fes medina for a fascinating look at a tradition going back 1000 years.\n",

      "Morocco’s souks and medinas are a joy for travel photographers\n",
      "7/ Primates in Uganda\n",
      "Uganda might not be a country that springs immediately to mind when you think of travel photography. It doesn’t have any of the instantly-recognisable, obviously-Instagrammable locations that might usually propel it onto lists like this one.\n",
      "But the fact that Uganda is less Insta-famous makes it a perfect place to travel for photography. There are no crowds of influencers here, just dozens of wonderful things to see . Head to Kibale and Bwindi National Parks in the west of the country to spend time with chimpanzees and the legendary mountain gorillas , or visit Queen Elizabeth National Park for vibrant green landscapes and ancient volcanic crater lakes.\n",
      "Read more: Using The Canon R5 For Wildlife Photography: A Full Review\n",
      "And everywhere you go as you travel round Uganda , you’ll find friendly and welcoming people who are not yet so fed up of tourists papping them that they resent it – instead if you ask nicely, most people will be happy to let you take their picture.\n",
      "Plan your Uganda photography adventure here\n",
      "Getting close to primates is one of the best things about visiting Uganda\n",
      "8/ The historic ruins of Turkey\n",
      "Turkey has been described as ‘the world’s largest outdoor museum’, a title well-earned thanks to the country’s fantastic architectural and historic heritage.\n",
      "Turkey sits on the border between Europe and Asia, and over the centuries has been invaded by everyone from the Greeks and Romans to the Persians and Mongols. All of whom left their mark on the country in different and fascinating ways – now a gift to you and me with our cameras.\n",
      "There are dozens upon dozens of ancient ruins in Turkey , from the legendary city of Troy to the rock temples of Midas City and the extraordinary landscape of Hierapolis-Pamukkale – all of which are great places for photography.\n",
      "Or you could head to the glorious city of Istanbul to photograph its stunning mosques and minarets as the sun goes down over the Bosphorus, and of course you cannot miss the world-famous ‘fairy chimneys’ of Cappadoccia.\n",
      "So if you’re looking for a place to travel for photography that features ancient history and architecture, all set in dramatic landscapes under a glorious Mediterranean sun , Turkey is the destination for you!\n",
      "Click here to search for Turkey adventures\n",
      "The splendid amphitheatre at Hierapolis in Turkey\n",
      "9/ Italy for… well… everything!\n",
      "Oh God, where do I start with Italy?! There’s so much choice for travel photographers, from the bewildering array of Roman ruins, to the sumptuous palaces and churches of cities like Florence and Verona, to the iconic canals and bridges of Venice, to the undulating landscapes of Tuscany, to the colourful painted towns of the Amalfi Coast and Cinque Terre, you could spend a year exploring Italy with your camera and still not have seen enough!\n",
      "Italy does have a reputation for being crowded – which is hardly surprising for country that is so accessible and has so much to offer – so if you want to avoid the crowds and take travel photos that are a bit less obvious, why not head to one of the slightly less touristy, but no less beautiful, parts of the country ?\n",
      "One top pick would be Trento , in the north. A charming city nestled in the foothills of the Dolomites, Trento offers both colourful Italian city views and gorgeous mountain scenery. Or head to Naples for history and architecture but with an edgy side.\n",
      "Or if pretty towns and villages are more your bag, avoid celebrity-famous Tuscany and go to Umbria instead, where places like Orvieto , Assisi and Todi offer plenty of opportunities to capture the real heart of Italy, away from the worst of the tourist madness.\n",

      "The pretty rooftops and dramatic scenery of Trento, Northern Italy\n",
      "10/ Colourful portraiture in Japan\n",
      "Japan is one of the best countries for photography because it has it all: gorgeous landscapes from mountains to islands, traditional culture from temples to food, and a population that loves taking photos and are more than willing to pose for you anytime, anywhere.\n",
      "It’s not difficult to find a great portrait to capture, whether you are interested in cosplay, robots, monks, and people dressed in kimono and yukata all over the country. The Japanese are more than happy to have you photograph them fishing, mending nets, hiking, doing sports like sumo or kendo, or even cooking in restaurants. This is pretty unusual when traveling around the world, so the one caution is not to get used to this openness if you travel to other countries.\n",
      "Closed off to the world for many centuries, the Japanese have retained much of their traditional culture. From welcoming in the New Year to celebrating many festivals all year long with parades, fireworks, and music and dance, there are ample opportunities to capture a glimpse into Japan’s history.\n",
      "The photo above was taken at  Kusatsu Onsen , a hot springs town, deep in the mountains where the water is so hot that women have been cooling it for centuries. If you are looking for a country to really allow your photographic skills to shine, book a trip to Japan!\n",

      "11/ The pristine Lofoten Islands, Norway\n",
      "Dramatic. Pristine. Breathtaking. These words only begin to describe the beauty of the Lofoten Islands in Norway . This remote archipelago of islands is off the western coast of Norway just within the Arctic Circle, and is widely lauded as one of the best places for photography in the world. It’s a photographer’s dream destination year-round, but especially in winter.\n",
      "During the day, drive between the islands capturing the iconic cabins, snow-covered beaches, arctic surfers, and dramatic rock formations jutting out of the fjords. And at night, this is an ideal location to photograph the magic of the Aurora Borealis.\n",
      "Hamnøy is a must on any photographer’s Lofoten Islands itinerary. Bright red cabins line the waterfront with breathtaking mountains along the horizon. The bridge is a great vantage point, especially during golden hour and after dark for nighttime photography.\n",
      "Other great photography spots include the view from Mt. Ryten, Rambergstranda Beach, Reine, and the fishing village of Nusfjord. You could easily spend several days exploring the islands and capturing the unique beauty of this place.\n",
      "If the Lofoten Islands are a bit too remote for you, don’t worry! Norway is one of the most photogenic places in the world. For the Northern Lights, consider alternatives such as Tromsø or Bodø. Or, closer to Oslo, get a taste of the fjords in either Bergen or Flåm. Or for something completely different, why not try visiting the Ice Music Festival !\n",

      "The Lofoten Islands in Norway are a bucket list place for travel photography\n",
      "12/ Off the beaten track in Georgia\n",
      "The Republic of Georgia is a dream destination for travel photographers of all stripes. From surreal mountain landscapes to picture-perfect street scenes, this tiny nation in the South Caucasus has it all.\n",
      "Georgia has a dozen climatic zones and no shortage of  unique places to visit , from alpine villages to semi-desert landscapes, cave monasteries to verdant tea fields and the subtropical Black Sea coast.\n",
      "The cities are an eclectic mix of medieval, Silk Road and Soviet styles. In Tbilisi, you’ll find everything from florid Art Nouveau mansions to Persian-style bathhouses and Brutalist commie buildings, all within a few city blocks. One of the best places for street photography is the local  bazari  – every town and city has its own vibrant marketplace where regional produce, spices and homemade cheese is sold.\n",
      "One of Georgia’s greatest assets is its cultural and religious diversity, especially in the Greater Caucasus mountains. Svaneti, Racha, Khevsureti and remote Tusheti all offer awe-inspiring landscapes and traditional architecture, most famously the UNESCO-listed Svan tower houses around western Georgia’s Mestia and Ushguli.\n",
      "Try to time your visit with one of Georgia’s cultural festivals. The Rtveli wine harvest in late autumn sees families around the country head out to their vineyards to pick and crush grapes. It’s an atmospheric, joyous time of year and a great chance to observe and photograph one of the nation’s most beloved traditions.\n",
      "Georgia is renowned for its warm hospitality (tradition dictates that every guest is a gift from God), and you’ll find that most people are very curious towards tourists and eager to strike up a conversation once you pull out your camera. Be mindful when taking photos of people’s homes or when photographing rural and remote areas as some communities are more conservative.\n",

      "13/ History and countryside in Provence, France\n",
      "There are few other places in France, or indeed Europe, that offer the diversity of landscapes that you’ll find in Provence. You could spend weeks snapping the quintessential hilltop villages, grand chateaux, sprawling vineyards, rustic olive groves, and plane tree-lined boulevards.\n",
      "And that’s just the countryside. Provence is also where you’ll find the Calanques National Park, with its dramatic fjords and idyllic beaches; the Verdon Gorge, touted as being the deepest canyon in Europe; Mt Sainte-Victoire, the subject of over 60 of local artist Cézanne’s paintings; and the Colorado Provençal, so named for its ochre-toned resemblance of the US state.\n",
      "Seasonally, the region shows off further, with floral displays to rival those found anywhere else in the world. Most famously, the  lavender fields of Provence  transform the plains of Valensole, Sault, and the Luberon into a fragrant wonderland. Visit in late June – mid July to catch them at their best, and aim for golden hour to catch the most beautiful hues. Less famous, but equally as enchanting, is the poppy season which transforms empty fields around the region into a splendour of red during the month of May.\n",

      "14/ The variety and diversity of Chile\n",
      "From mountains, to deserts, sandy beaches, and everything in between, Chile is one of the most diverse countries for travel photography.\n",
      "In the North, the San Pedro de Atacama desert (considered the driest desert in the world) provides stunning rocky desert terrain for landscape photography. Near the centre of the country, the capital city of Santiago sits right below the towering, snow-capped Andes Mountain range, making for a surreal view on a clear day. Santiago is considered one of the safest cities in South America and is rich with history and inspiring architecture.\n",
      "Towards the Pacific, the bohemian, sea-side town of Valparaíso has attracted artists for decades to its colourful streets and gorgeous coastline. Here you can be sure to lose yourself among the city’s famed muralled walls and imaginative street art.\n",
      "As you venture way to the county’s south, you will reach the famous Patagonia region. World-renowned for its rugged and rough terrain, unique wildlife (who could forget the guanacos!), and incredible glaciers, Patagonia is an unmissable destination for photography in Chile. The Torres Del Paine National Park is home to awe-inspiring mountain views and excellent hiking trails. Nature lovers can camp under the stars, or those that prefer a little more comfort can stay in one of Torres del Paine’s range of hotels .\n",

      "15/ Stunning architecture in Uzbekistan\n",
      "Around every corner and down every alley in Uzbekistan awaits stunning architecture in contrasting styles that will keep you on your toes and challenge your photography skills.\n",
      "The capital, Tashkent, has numerous communist-style buildings with hard concrete edges. However, the best clicks are underground in Tashkent’s famous subway. Each station is an architectural masterpiece that you have to see to believe. Since 2018 it has been legal to take photos in the subway.\n",
      "As you head into the heart of Uzbekistan, the communist architecture fades, and a world teeming with breathtaking Islamic architecture appears. Bukhara’s central square features massive madrasas with blue domes and intricate, colorful tile work. In Samarkand, the mausoleum complex of Shah-i-Zinda and the Registan is dazzlingly beautiful.\n",
      "Budget time to wander the side streets and enjoy the simple residential architecture for a completely different travel photography experience. The light is always the harshest at mid-day, so it is best to get up with the sunrise, take a mid-day break and revisit places as the sun sets. The changing light from morning to dusk will bring an entirely new feel to each image.\n",
      "Make sure you pack a wide-angle, a 35mm or 50mm, and a tripod. Uzbekistan is not ultra-conservative, but you should dress modestly and respect dress codes for entering certain areas such as the mausoleum.\n",
      "By Susanna Kelly-Shankar from Curiosity Saves Travel\n",
      "Don’t miss Uzbekistan. Start planning now!\n",
      "Colourful architecture makes Uzbekistan one of the best locations for photography\n",
      "16/ The dramatic Canadian Rockies\n",
      "In the Canadian Rockies you’re spoiled for travel photography choice; pick from the gorgeous mountain drama of Lake Louise, or drive a bit further north to Jasper National Park , the largest of them all.\n",
      "Lake Louise is located in Banff National Park and is one of the prettiest – and most photographed – natural attractions in Canada . Head here for the iconic views and dramatic landscapes that give Canada its well-deserved reputation as one of the best places to travel for photographers.\n",
      "Or, if you prefer something slightly more original, try Jasper National Park, which is home to a variety of wild animals, from small mammals like beavers, weasels and porcupines to larger animals like moose, caribou and bears . It’s actually surprisingly easy to capture them on a snowy day, or when road tripping on the Icefield Parkway.\n",
      "Jasper is also a stargazer’s paradise. So if you are into astrophotography, add Jasper to your itinerary .\n",
      "Accessing hiking and skiing trails in the Canadian Rockies is safe, at all times of the year, just prepare well, make sure you adhere to road closures and weather warnings, and keep a sensible distance from any wildlife you may encounter.\n",

      "17/ The Emerald Isle: Ireland\n",
      "Whether you have a few days or a few weeks to spend in Ireland, you will still feel you don’t have enough time to capture everything you’d like to. From breathtaking vistas and incredible geological formations, the coast alone will keep you busy.\n",
      "Visit the famous Cliffs of Moher and the Giant’s Causeway, but also make sure to stop off at to lesser-known places. You will be rewarded with colourful villages, dramatic cliffs, lighthouses, and old forts.\n",
      "The inland rural areas shouldn’t be disregarded either. Ireland has the brightest green country you’ll ever find, and that green is scattered with castles and quiet pastures everywhere. Even the morning fog is a feature worth waking up early for.\n",
      "If you prefer urban photography, head to Dublin. From the different Gothic styles of St Patrick’s Cathedral and Christ Church Cathedral to the colourful Temple Bar area, it’s a wonderful city to travel for photographers.\n",
      "Add to that the collection of Georgian doors, 24 bridges, and many historical buildings, and you should have your hands full for a while. Around Dublin , more castles and old Irish estates are open for visitors. Take your camera and explore those sunken gardens, old structures, and unique details.\n",

      "With landscapes as diverse as the Gobi Desert, Himalayan Mountains, karst pillars, mighty rivers and lush jungle,  China  is a fantastic place to travel for photographers.\n",
      "This vast, and often untamed land, has endless possibilities when it comes to landscape photography. In addition to the obvious places like the Great Wall of China, the karst mountains on the Li River and the ancient Silk Road, China offers plenty of true “hidden gems”.\n",
      "If you really want to discover some of the magic of the Middle Kingdom, then head to Tibet. From yaks grazing beside emerald lakes beneath the highest peaks on earth to windswept plateaus where prayer flags flutter on the wind, Tibet is one of the best places in the world for photography.\n",
      "Other places such as the Rainbow Mountains at Zhangye, Crescent Moon Lake and the Singing Sand Dunes at Dunhuang, beautiful Hangzhou and West Lake and the rainforests of Hainan Island all provide inspiration for photographers.\n",
      "No trip to China would be complete without discovering some of the country’s 5,000-year history and culture. To get the most of your photography trip to China consider staying at least three weeks and including Beijing, Xi’an, Chengdu and Hangzhou on your itinerary.\n",
      "As with travelling anywhere, avoid photography of officials, police, soldiers and related buildings. The Chinese authorities can be overly sensitive sometimes, so if in doubt, always ask (officials are friendly and approachable).\n",

      "If you’re a travel photographer who loves landscapes, you should definitely consider wild Namibia, in southern Africa. Its dramatic scenery has been forged over millennia by volcanic eruptions, desertification and erosion, resulting in stunning craters, mountains and vast canyons.\n",
      "However, most come for the Namib Desert, believed to be the oldest desert in the world.  There is a lot to see in the  Namib Desert , but the two best spots for desert photography are Sossusvlei and Sandwich Harbour.\n",
      "Sossusvlei is an area of dried-up marshland deep in the heart of the Namib sand sea.  It is surrounded by huge curvy red dunes, and the floor is cracked white clay. In Deadvlei, the remains of blackened dead trees twist as if stuck in a macabre dance. In the early morning, you can catch the first rays lighting up the dunes and in the midday sun, the contrasting colours are vibrant and striking.\n",
      "Sandwich Harbour is where the desert meets the sea, towering golden dunes facing into the ferocious South Atlantic. You’ll need a 4×4 and knowledge of the tide to get there, as the route is along the narrow beach between the dunes and the sea – but the scenery is worth the nail-gripping ride!\n",
      "And the good news is, the photography opportunities don’t end with the desert: the infamous Skeleton Coast of Namibia is dotted with shipwrecks, there are deserted diamond mining towns and there’s a huge amount of wildlife , including lions, elephants, leopards and giraffes. There are also tribes that maintain their traditional way of living, including the fascinating Himba people.\n",

      "20/ Architecture and nature in Vietnam\n",
      "Vietnam is an incredible destination for travel photography – from cities to ancient temples and stunning natural beauty, this Southeast Asian country has something for everyone.\n",
      "For wonderful cityscapes, head to Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi, where modern skyscrapers and colonial buildings are the perfect juxtaposition against the bustling markets and thousands of scooters zooming through the city streets.\n",
      "If you’re looking for a smaller city with interesting street photography, the small city of Hoi An is worth a stop, with its famous yellow-walled Old Quarter, the nightly releasing of floating lanterns down its river, and the fascinating intersection of Chinese and French architecture.\n",
      "Are you seeking more natural beauty? Consider Ha Long Bay, where dramatic limestone casts tower over the turquoise Gulf of Tonkin, or Sa Pa, a town to Vietnam’s northwest that’s comprised of impossibly green rice terraces as far as the eye can see.\n",
      "If you’re looking for something slightly less touristy than Ha Long, check out Ninh Binh, which offers similar landscapes, with limestone monoliths topped with lush greenery – but this time, the mountains are land-bound and carved out with mysterious caves.\n",

      "Often portrayed negatively by the media, Iran is a welcoming country rich with culture, history, and the most breathtaking mosques. It is also incredibly safe to travel to and to wander around with your camera.\n",
      "Start your Iran photography trip in Shiraz, home to the mesmerizing Nasir-ol-Molk Mosque. Get there early in the morning, right when it opens, to secure the best photo spot (it can get very crowded and competitive!). Then, as you watch the sun rise, the colors of the mosque’s stained glass windows begin reflecting on the carpet, creating a rainbow light show.\n",
      "Another incredible place for architectural photography in Iran is the city of Isfahan, home to the magnificent Naqsh-e Jahan Square. This square is filled with history, and is framed by two incredibly gorgeous mosques: Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque and Shah Mosque. The intricate mosaic tiles inside these mosques are simply unbelievable, and you can easily spend hours photographing them from different angles.\n",
      "To get the best architecture shots in Iran, shoot at sunrise or very early in the morning for the best lighting and the least amount of tourists. Keep in mind that the architecture in Iran is also very majestic, so having adequate gear, such as some solid wide-angle lenses for the Sony a7III , would really help capture the scale of the mosques. Be sure to also bring some wide-aperture lenses as some of the mosques are pretty dimly lit.\n",

      "Iran is an often-overlooked place to travel for photographers\n",
      "22/ Ancient and modern life in Jordan\n",
      "There are quite a few places in Jordan that are perfect for travel photography, irrespective of the type of photography you like.\n",
      "Areas like the world-famous Petra and the Dana Biosphere are fantastic for landscape photography. Meanwhile Wadi Rum should be included in your  Jordan itinerary  as it’s one of those rare places where you can see the Milky Way clearly, making it unmissable for night photography in Jordan.\n",
      "If you like murals, food photography, portraits and street photography, head to Amman. Most of the locals are accommodating and let you click pictures if you ask politely. While there aren’t specific street photography tours conducted in Amman, the Downtown area is where you’ll find more of the historical and cultural aspects of the capital.\n",
      "good places for photography\n",
      "You can take pictures at places like the Dead Sea; however, make sure you don’t let a single drop of water touch the camera as it is super salty!\n",
      "The best time to visit Jordan is in spring and autumn when it isn’t too hot or too cold as it does tend to get quite cold in winter.\n",

      "23/ The grandeur of the USA’s National Parks\n",
      "The USA’s famous National Parks are full of opportunities to photograph wildlife, natural wonders, and beautiful landscapes. Two of the most popular – and with good reason – are Yellowstone and Yosemite, both of which are fantastic destinations for travel photography.\n",
      "There are endless  things to do in Yellowstone , but if you’re a photographer, probably the only thing you’re going to want to do is take pictures! But you’ll need to get up early – the morning light makes for beautiful images and if wildlife photography is your thing, you’ll also find that the animals tend to be most active early in the day. Lamar Valley is a popular place to see wildlife.\n",
      "For iconic landscape photography spots, head to Grand Prismatic Overlook, Old Faithful, Artist Point, and Mammoth Hot Springs.\n",
      "If you’re heading to Yosemite National Park, the best time to go is in the spring. The waterfalls have a large volume because of snowmelt and the dogwoods are in bloom.\n",
      "Head to the Tunnel View lookout around sunset for one of Yosemite’s most celebrated views, or try Glacier Point, Three Brothers, Half Dome, and Yosemite Falls for more good places for photography.\n",

      "Home to colourful streets, beautiful monuments, and incredible natural scenery, India is a diverse country with plenty under its belt. Whether you like photographing architecture, wildlife, or portraits of Indians , there is something to interest any visiting photographer here.\n",
      "If you are planning to travel to India for the first time, then make sure to spend some days exploring the princely state of Rajasthan. Steeped in royal history, this region of India boasts numerous palaces, forts, and temples. You can fly into the Instagram-famous  pink city of Jaipur  and travel to Jodhpur and Udaipur before making your way to the Thar Desert in Jaisalmer. The Ranthambore National Park in Sawai Madhopur is also a must for tiger safaris during the winter season.\n",
      "Read more: Taking The Sleeper Train In India: What’s It Really Like?\n",
      "Just keep in mind that some religious places like temples and cenotaphs may not allow photography. It is best to ask a caretaker if unsure or wait for the prayers to finish. Another thing to note is that tripods are generally not allowed in most touristy places in India.\n",
      "Alternatively, for greener landscapes, check out Kerala in the south. The hill station of Munnar is widely famous for its acres of tea plantations and is one of the best places to photograph in India.\n",
      "You can spend a couple of days there and then head back down to experience the houseboats sailing on the backwaters of Kerala. If possible, opt to stay in one for a night or two and click away as you catch panoramas of palm trees and water lilies while onboard. It is particularly magical at sunrise and sunset.\n",

      "A  road trip to Alaska  should be a bucket list place to travel for photographers. The last frontier State is huge, and its wild beauty so unique and mind-blowing, that it offers plenty to see and discover.\n",
      "Alaska is a real playground for travel photographers, with history, breathtaking icy landscapes, abundant wildlife, stunning hiking trails, and some of the most scenic roads in the United States, even in the world! If you are into wildlife photography , Alaska also offers plenty of opportunities, with whales, bears, and hundreds of species of birds.\n",
      "Head to Seward, where you can take a boat tour and photograph icebergs and wildlife such as seals and whales. Or try Denali National Park, a world-class setting for wildlife photography enthusiasts.\n",
      "But the most spectacular treat that Alaska offers to any travel photographer is the opportunity to capture the Northern Lights . Fairbanks is one of the best places to see the Aurora Borealis in the world, because of its location and lack of light pollution. If you haven’t photographed the lights before, a Fairbanks northern lights tour is a great way to maximise your chances of seeing them, as the local guide will be able to plan the best time and location for epic Aurora images.\n",

The best months to travel economically are March and early April, when the weather is mild. For activities, explore free attractions such as the many parks, shrines, and temples around the city.

Areas like Akihabara also work. \" SammyFD \" Besides Asakusa, areas with cheaper hotels include Tsukiji, Gotanda, and Hatchobori. These neighborhoods can be worth exploring for budget-friendly stays. \" Bargainhunter \" For long stays, consider Toyoko Inn's Ikebukuro locations which often have more room availability. \" When to Go Grey Suitcases \" You’re too early - try in mid-July/August earliest. \" Eat & Drink Global715255 \" Why can't you go to nearby coffee shops or McDonald's to have breakfast? \" Getting Around SammyFD \" Many stations have elevators or escalators that reach the street level.

      "When I’m out and about with my camera in a dream location, and everywhere I look there are photo opportunities galore, the light is perfect, my heart is racing with the thrill… well it really doesn’t get any better than that!\n",
      "So when I’m researching my next trip, I’m always looking for incredible places to travel for photography.\n",
      "Where has the most stunning architecture, the most unique culture, the most colourful characters?\n",
      "Where has abundant wildlife or incredible landscapes? Where is safe enough to wander with a camera; where has the friendliest people who’ll let me take their portrait?\n",
      "Myanmar is a great place to travel if you enjoy photographing colourful characters\n",
      "Now, having travelled to over 70 countries and photographed in many of the world’s most celebrated travel photography destinations, I thought I’d make a list of the very best ones. Click the links within each section to take you to some of the images I shot there.\n",
      "Of course, there are still plenty more I haven’t had the chance to visit yet. So just in case I’d missed a few gems off my travel photography bucket list, I reached out to some fellow travel experts and asked them to report back on what they think is the top place to travel for photographers.\n",
      "This is by no means an exhaustive list, and I’m sure there are loads of wonderfully photogenic places I’ve missed. But there are certainly some stunning travel photography destinations in here, and I hope that within this list, you’ll find plenty of inspiration for your next travel photography trip!\n",
      "Top places to visit for travel photography\n",
      "1/ The icy landscapes of Antarctica\n",
      "There’s a reason why Antarctica is right at the top of most travel photographers’ bucket lists. With its gorgeous icy landscapes, mirror-calm bays, majestic glaciers, icebergs the size of houses, and clear wintry light, it’s landscape photography heaven. In fact it’s virtually impossible to take a bad photo here!\n",
      "And that’s before you even consider the wildlife – with six species of seals and eight types of penguins , not to mention whales and seabirds, Antarctica has everything to offer the passionate wildlife photographer too.\n",

      "It’s not easy to get there, and it isn’t cheap either, so a trip to Antarctica is probably a once-in-a-lifetime, bucket list pick for most travel photographers. Only problem is: once you’ve been there, you just want to go back!\n",

      "2/ Eye-catching street photography in Cuba\n",
      "If street photography is more your thing, then look no further than Cuba. Neglected by the Castro regime and battered by the US embargo that prevented any modernisation, Cuba has been effectively locked in a time warp for decades. But while this has been terrible for the country and its people in many ways, there’s no denying that it has made Cuba a dream destination for travel photographers.\n",
      "Wander the Cuban city streets in Havana and Trinidad and you’ll be spoilt for photography choice, with colourful historic buildings at every turn. Get lost down alleyways and side roads, delighting in the crumbling paintwork, the ornate wrought-iron decorations, and the brightly-painted shutters that cheerily hide the dilapidation within. Smile at the friendly Cuban people, who welcome visitors and don’t seem to mind having their photos taken.\n",
      "And then of course there are the famous Cuban cars , which roll the streets like living antiques. If you’re anything like me you can easily while away many hours photographing them from every angle, even missing dinner! Which is no great loss, because the food in Cuba is pretty terrible – but it’s a small price to pay for all the stunning photos you’ll bring home.\n",
      "Read more: Ethical Travel Photography: How To Capture With A Conscience\n",
      "Havana is filled with colourful buildings and classic cars, making it a brilliant place for travel photography\n",
      "3/ Myanmar: the world’s friendliest people\n",
      "Myanmar was on my travel photography bucket list for the longest time. And when I finally went there, I was not disappointed. Everywhere you go there are endless delights, from the golden glinting Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, to the ancient temples at Bagan , to the impossibly photogenic leg-rowing fishermen of Inle Lake , to the bustling markets .\n",
      "But the thing I loved best about travel photography in Myanmar was the people. Not only do they look fabulous, from the colourful street vendors to the red-robed Buddhist monks , but they were among the most friendly people I’ve ever met. Because Myanmar was closed to tourism for so long, its people are still just really happy to have visitors, and it shows in their generous and warm welcome. I don’t think a single person said no to me taking their photo!\n",
      "Sadly the political situation in Myanmar has deteriorated since I was there and some areas are not safe to visit. So you may need to think carefully about if and when to go, but if you do get the chance, I don’t think you’ll regret it!\n",

      "4/ The colours of Guatemala\n",
      "There aren’t all that many countries left in the world where the culture and way of life still seems very little changed by the unstoppable rush of modernity – but Guatemala is one of them.\n",
      "Guatemala is bursting with colourful towns , dramatic landscapes, and ancient cultural treasures . Lush rainforests, towering volcanoes exploding into the sky , and shimmering turquoise lakes provide stunning backdrops for your shots.\n",
      "Step back in time with captivating Mayan ruins like Tikal, where towering temples pierce the jungle canopy. Capture the energy of vibrant markets overflowing with handcrafted textiles and fresh produce. Antigua, a UNESCO World Heritage Site , offers charming cobblestone streets, pastel-painted colonial buildings, and majestic volcanoes as a backdrop.\n",
      "Beyond the scenery, Guatemala’s heart lies in its people. Photograph the smiles of indigenous communities dressed in traditional clothing (though you’ll need to be respectful and ask permission first, as many local people don’t like having their picture taken).\n",
      "While you may be worried about safety in Guatemala , as long as you take sensible precautions, you should be fine. I spent 3 months exploring this amazing country with my camera, and came back with some of the best photos of my life .\n",

      "5/ Glaciers and Northern Lights in Iceland\n",
      "For landscape photographers, there are few better places to travel than Iceland. Whether you go in summer or winter, or any time in between, there are endless opportunities for gorgeous photos of snow-capped mountains, thundering waterfalls , crashing waves, black sand beaches, calving glaciers and icy lagoons.\n",
      "Drive the ring road along the south coast and a journey of two hours will end up taking four as you stop endlessly for photos. Don’t miss the chance to walk inside a glacier ice cave, hike on a glacier , photograph fearsome sneaker waves , or admire the adorable Icelandic horses .\n",
      "And then of course there are the legendary Northern Lights . Take a Northern Lights tour from Reykjavik and if you’re lucky with the timing and the weather, you can turn your already epic Iceland photos into something you’ll be showing off for the rest of your life.\n",

      "6/ The souks and medinas of Morocco\n",
      "Like many of the countries on this list, Morocco doesn’t have just one thing to offer the enthusiastic travel photographer. You’ll have heard of the famous blue city of Chefchaouen , for example, which is certainly photogenic (if a little overrun with Instagrammers). Or the dramatic beauty of the Atlas mountains, or the rolling dunes and clear starry skies of the Sahara Desert .\n",
      "But for travel photography , the part I loved best were the twisty alleyways and colourful stalls of the medinas in Fes and Marrakech. These atmospheric mazes of streets and shops are easy to get lost in, but that’s part of the joy: no matter where you wander you’ll stumble across fascinating people and things to point your camera at.\n",
      "You’ll need to be sensitive, as many of the shoppers and traders don’t like having their photos taken, but if you’re subtle and respectful, you’ll come home with striking and unique images. Don’t miss the striking Chouara Tannery inside Fes medina for a fascinating look at a tradition going back 1000 years.\n",

      "Morocco’s souks and medinas are a joy for travel photographers\n",
      "7/ Primates in Uganda\n",
      "Uganda might not be a country that springs immediately to mind when you think of travel photography. It doesn’t have any of the instantly-recognisable, obviously-Instagrammable locations that might usually propel it onto lists like this one.\n",
      "But the fact that Uganda is less Insta-famous makes it a perfect place to travel for photography. There are no crowds of influencers here, just dozens of wonderful things to see . Head to Kibale and Bwindi National Parks in the west of the country to spend time with chimpanzees and the legendary mountain gorillas , or visit Queen Elizabeth National Park for vibrant green landscapes and ancient volcanic crater lakes.\n",
      "Read more: Using The Canon R5 For Wildlife Photography: A Full Review\n",
      "And everywhere you go as you travel round Uganda , you’ll find friendly and welcoming people who are not yet so fed up of tourists papping them that they resent it – instead if you ask nicely, most people will be happy to let you take their picture.\n",
      "Plan your Uganda photography adventure here\n",
      "Getting close to primates is one of the best things about visiting Uganda\n",
      "8/ The historic ruins of Turkey\n",
      "Turkey has been described as ‘the world’s largest outdoor museum’, a title well-earned thanks to the country’s fantastic architectural and historic heritage.\n",
      "Turkey sits on the border between Europe and Asia, and over the centuries has been invaded by everyone from the Greeks and Romans to the Persians and Mongols. All of whom left their mark on the country in different and fascinating ways – now a gift to you and me with our cameras.\n",
      "There are dozens upon dozens of ancient ruins in Turkey , from the legendary city of Troy to the rock temples of Midas City and the extraordinary landscape of Hierapolis-Pamukkale – all of which are great places for photography.\n",
      "Or you could head to the glorious city of Istanbul to photograph its stunning mosques and minarets as the sun goes down over the Bosphorus, and of course you cannot miss the world-famous ‘fairy chimneys’ of Cappadoccia.\n",
      "So if you’re looking for a place to travel for photography that features ancient history and architecture, all set in dramatic landscapes under a glorious Mediterranean sun , Turkey is the destination for you!\n",

      "The splendid amphitheatre at Hierapolis in Turkey\n",
      "9/ Italy for… well… everything!\n",
      "Oh God, where do I start with Italy?! There’s so much choice for travel photographers, from the bewildering array of Roman ruins, to the sumptuous palaces and churches of cities like Florence and Verona, to the iconic canals and bridges of Venice, to the undulating landscapes of Tuscany, to the colourful painted towns of the Amalfi Coast and Cinque Terre, you could spend a year exploring Italy with your camera and still not have seen enough!\n",
      "Italy does have a reputation for being crowded – which is hardly surprising for country that is so accessible and has so much to offer – so if you want to avoid the crowds and take travel photos that are a bit less obvious, why not head to one of the slightly less touristy, but no less beautiful, parts of the country ?\n",
      "One top pick would be Trento , in the north. A charming city nestled in the foothills of the Dolomites, Trento offers both colourful Italian city views and gorgeous mountain scenery. Or head to Naples for history and architecture but with an edgy side.\n",
      "Or if pretty towns and villages are more your bag, avoid celebrity-famous Tuscany and go to Umbria instead, where places like Orvieto , Assisi and Todi offer plenty of opportunities to capture the real heart of Italy, away from the worst of the tourist madness.\n",

      "The pretty rooftops and dramatic scenery of Trento, Northern Italy\n",
      "10/ Colourful portraiture in Japan\n",
      "Japan is one of the best countries for photography because it has it all: gorgeous landscapes from mountains to islands, traditional culture from temples to food, and a population that loves taking photos and are more than willing to pose for you anytime, anywhere.\n",
      "It’s not difficult to find a great portrait to capture, whether you are interested in cosplay, robots, monks, and people dressed in kimono and yukata all over the country. The Japanese are more than happy to have you photograph them fishing, mending nets, hiking, doing sports like sumo or kendo, or even cooking in restaurants. This is pretty unusual when traveling around the world, so the one caution is not to get used to this openness if you travel to other countries.\n",
      "Closed off to the world for many centuries, the Japanese have retained much of their traditional culture. From welcoming in the New Year to celebrating many festivals all year long with parades, fireworks, and music and dance, there are ample opportunities to capture a glimpse into Japan’s history.\n",
      "The photo above was taken at  Kusatsu Onsen , a hot springs town, deep in the mountains where the water is so hot that women have been cooling it for centuries. If you are looking for a country to really allow your photographic skills to shine, book a trip to Japan!\n",

      "11/ The pristine Lofoten Islands, Norway\n",
      "Dramatic. Pristine. Breathtaking. These words only begin to describe the beauty of the Lofoten Islands in Norway . This remote archipelago of islands is off the western coast of Norway just within the Arctic Circle, and is widely lauded as one of the best places for photography in the world. It’s a photographer’s dream destination year-round, but especially in winter.\n",
      "During the day, drive between the islands capturing the iconic cabins, snow-covered beaches, arctic surfers, and dramatic rock formations jutting out of the fjords. And at night, this is an ideal location to photograph the magic of the Aurora Borealis.\n",
      "Hamnøy is a must on any photographer’s Lofoten Islands itinerary. Bright red cabins line the waterfront with breathtaking mountains along the horizon. The bridge is a great vantage point, especially during golden hour and after dark for nighttime photography.\n",
      "Other great photography spots include the view from Mt. Ryten, Rambergstranda Beach, Reine, and the fishing village of Nusfjord. You could easily spend several days exploring the islands and capturing the unique beauty of this place.\n",
      "If the Lofoten Islands are a bit too remote for you, don’t worry! Norway is one of the most photogenic places in the world. For the Northern Lights, consider alternatives such as Tromsø or Bodø. Or, closer to Oslo, get a taste of the fjords in either Bergen or Flåm. Or for something completely different, why not try visiting the Ice Music Festival !\n",

      "12/ Off the beaten track in Georgia\n",
      "The Republic of Georgia is a dream destination for travel photographers of all stripes. From surreal mountain landscapes to picture-perfect street scenes, this tiny nation in the South Caucasus has it all.\n",
      "Georgia has a dozen climatic zones and no shortage of  unique places to visit , from alpine villages to semi-desert landscapes, cave monasteries to verdant tea fields and the subtropical Black Sea coast.\n",
      "The cities are an eclectic mix of medieval, Silk Road and Soviet styles. In Tbilisi, you’ll find everything from florid Art Nouveau mansions to Persian-style bathhouses and Brutalist commie buildings, all within a few city blocks. One of the best places for street photography is the local  bazari  – every town and city has its own vibrant marketplace where regional produce, spices and homemade cheese is sold.\n",
      "One of Georgia’s greatest assets is its cultural and religious diversity, especially in the Greater Caucasus mountains. Svaneti, Racha, Khevsureti and remote Tusheti all offer awe-inspiring landscapes and traditional architecture, most famously the UNESCO-listed Svan tower houses around western Georgia’s Mestia and Ushguli.\n",
      "Try to time your visit with one of Georgia’s cultural festivals. The Rtveli wine harvest in late autumn sees families around the country head out to their vineyards to pick and crush grapes. It’s an atmospheric, joyous time of year and a great chance to observe and photograph one of the nation’s most beloved traditions.\n",
      "Georgia is renowned for its warm hospitality (tradition dictates that every guest is a gift from God), and you’ll find that most people are very curious towards tourists and eager to strike up a conversation once you pull out your camera. Be mindful when taking photos of people’s homes or when photographing rural and remote areas as some communities are more conservative.\n",

      "13/ History and countryside in Provence, France\n",
      "There are few other places in France, or indeed Europe, that offer the diversity of landscapes that you’ll find in Provence. You could spend weeks snapping the quintessential hilltop villages, grand chateaux, sprawling vineyards, rustic olive groves, and plane tree-lined boulevards.\n",
      "And that’s just the countryside. Provence is also where you’ll find the Calanques National Park, with its dramatic fjords and idyllic beaches; the Verdon Gorge, touted as being the deepest canyon in Europe; Mt Sainte-Victoire, the subject of over 60 of local artist Cézanne’s paintings; and the Colorado Provençal, so named for its ochre-toned resemblance of the US state.\n",
      "Seasonally, the region shows off further, with floral displays to rival those found anywhere else in the world. Most famously, the  lavender fields of Provence  transform the plains of Valensole, Sault, and the Luberon into a fragrant wonderland. Visit in late June – mid July to catch them at their best, and aim for golden hour to catch the most beautiful hues. Less famous, but equally as enchanting, is the poppy season which transforms empty fields around the region into a splendour of red during the month of May.\n",

      "14/ The variety and diversity of Chile\n",
      "From mountains, to deserts, sandy beaches, and everything in between, Chile is one of the most diverse countries for travel photography.\n",
      "In the North, the San Pedro de Atacama desert (considered the driest desert in the world) provides stunning rocky desert terrain for landscape photography. Near the centre of the country, the capital city of Santiago sits right below the towering, snow-capped Andes Mountain range, making for a surreal view on a clear day. Santiago is considered one of the safest cities in South America and is rich with history and inspiring architecture.\n",
      "Towards the Pacific, the bohemian, sea-side town of Valparaíso has attracted artists for decades to its colourful streets and gorgeous coastline. Here you can be sure to lose yourself among the city’s famed muralled walls and imaginative street art.\n",
      "As you venture way to the county’s south, you will reach the famous Patagonia region. World-renowned for its rugged and rough terrain, unique wildlife (who could forget the guanacos!), and incredible glaciers, Patagonia is an unmissable destination for photography in Chile. The Torres Del Paine National Park is home to awe-inspiring mountain views and excellent hiking trails. Nature lovers can camp under the stars, or those that prefer a little more comfort can stay in one of Torres del Paine’s range of hotels .\n",

      "15/ Stunning architecture in Uzbekistan\n",
      "Around every corner and down every alley in Uzbekistan awaits stunning architecture in contrasting styles that will keep you on your toes and challenge your photography skills.\n",
      "The capital, Tashkent, has numerous communist-style buildings with hard concrete edges. However, the best clicks are underground in Tashkent’s famous subway. Each station is an architectural masterpiece that you have to see to believe. Since 2018 it has been legal to take photos in the subway.\n",
      "As you head into the heart of Uzbekistan, the communist architecture fades, and a world teeming with breathtaking Islamic architecture appears. Bukhara’s central square features massive madrasas with blue domes and intricate, colorful tile work. In Samarkand, the mausoleum complex of Shah-i-Zinda and the Registan is dazzlingly beautiful.\n",
      "Budget time to wander the side streets and enjoy the simple residential architecture for a completely different travel photography experience. The light is always the harshest at mid-day, so it is best to get up with the sunrise, take a mid-day break and revisit places as the sun sets. The changing light from morning to dusk will bring an entirely new feel to each image.\n",
      "Make sure you pack a wide-angle, a 35mm or 50mm, and a tripod. Uzbekistan is not ultra-conservative, but you should dress modestly and respect dress codes for entering certain areas such as the mausoleum.\n",

      "16/ The dramatic Canadian Rockies\n",
      "In the Canadian Rockies you’re spoiled for travel photography choice; pick from the gorgeous mountain drama of Lake Louise, or drive a bit further north to Jasper National Park , the largest of them all.\n",
      "Lake Louise is located in Banff National Park and is one of the prettiest – and most photographed – natural attractions in Canada . Head here for the iconic views and dramatic landscapes that give Canada its well-deserved reputation as one of the best places to travel for photographers.\n",
      "Or, if you prefer something slightly more original, try Jasper National Park, which is home to a variety of wild animals, from small mammals like beavers, weasels and porcupines to larger animals like moose, caribou and bears . It’s actually surprisingly easy to capture them on a snowy day, or when road tripping on the Icefield Parkway.\n",
      "Jasper is also a stargazer’s paradise. So if you are into astrophotography, add Jasper to your itinerary .\n",
      "Accessing hiking and skiing trails in the Canadian Rockies is safe, at all times of the year, just prepare well, make sure you adhere to road closures and weather warnings, and keep a sensible distance from any wildlife you may encounter.\n",

      "Whether you have a few days or a few weeks to spend in Ireland, you will still feel you don’t have enough time to capture everything you’d like to. From breathtaking vistas and incredible geological formations, the coast alone will keep you busy.\n",
      "Visit the famous Cliffs of Moher and the Giant’s Causeway, but also make sure to stop off at to lesser-known places. You will be rewarded with colourful villages, dramatic cliffs, lighthouses, and old forts.\n",
      "The inland rural areas shouldn’t be disregarded either. Ireland has the brightest green country you’ll ever find, and that green is scattered with castles and quiet pastures everywhere. Even the morning fog is a feature worth waking up early for.\n",
      "If you prefer urban photography, head to Dublin. From the different Gothic styles of St Patrick’s Cathedral and Christ Church Cathedral to the colourful Temple Bar area, it’s a wonderful city to travel for photographers.\n",
      "Add to that the collection of Georgian doors, 24 bridges, and many historical buildings, and you should have your hands full for a while. Around Dublin , more castles and old Irish estates are open for visitors. Take your camera and explore those sunken gardens, old structures, and unique details.\n",

      "With landscapes as diverse as the Gobi Desert, Himalayan Mountains, karst pillars, mighty rivers and lush jungle,  China  is a fantastic place to travel for photographers.\n",
      "This vast, and often untamed land, has endless possibilities when it comes to landscape photography. In addition to the obvious places like the Great Wall of China, the karst mountains on the Li River and the ancient Silk Road, China offers plenty of true “hidden gems”.\n",
      "If you really want to discover some of the magic of the Middle Kingdom, then head to Tibet. From yaks grazing beside emerald lakes beneath the highest peaks on earth to windswept plateaus where prayer flags flutter on the wind, Tibet is one of the best places in the world for photography.\n",
      "Other places such as the Rainbow Mountains at Zhangye, Crescent Moon Lake and the Singing Sand Dunes at Dunhuang, beautiful Hangzhou and West Lake and the rainforests of Hainan Island all provide inspiration for photographers.\n",
      "No trip to China would be complete without discovering some of the country’s 5,000-year history and culture. To get the most of your photography trip to China consider staying at least three weeks and including Beijing, Xi’an, Chengdu and Hangzhou on your itinerary.\n",
      "As with travelling anywhere, avoid photography of officials, police, soldiers and related buildings. The Chinese authorities can be overly sensitive sometimes, so if in doubt, always ask (officials are friendly and approachable).\n",

      "If you’re a travel photographer who loves landscapes, you should definitely consider wild Namibia, in southern Africa. Its dramatic scenery has been forged over millennia by volcanic eruptions, desertification and erosion, resulting in stunning craters, mountains and vast canyons.\n",
      "However, most come for the Namib Desert, believed to be the oldest desert in the world.  There is a lot to see in the  Namib Desert , but the two best spots for desert photography are Sossusvlei and Sandwich Harbour.\n",
      "Sossusvlei is an area of dried-up marshland deep in the heart of the Namib sand sea.  It is surrounded by huge curvy red dunes, and the floor is cracked white clay. In Deadvlei, the remains of blackened dead trees twist as if stuck in a macabre dance. In the early morning, you can catch the first rays lighting up the dunes and in the midday sun, the contrasting colours are vibrant and striking.\n",
      "Sandwich Harbour is where the desert meets the sea, towering golden dunes facing into the ferocious South Atlantic. You’ll need a 4×4 and knowledge of the tide to get there, as the route is along the narrow beach between the dunes and the sea – but the scenery is worth the nail-gripping ride!\n",
      "And the good news is, the photography opportunities don’t end with the desert: the infamous Skeleton Coast of Namibia is dotted with shipwrecks, there are deserted diamond mining towns and there’s a huge amount of wildlife , including lions, elephants, leopards and giraffes. There are also tribes that maintain their traditional way of living, including the fascinating Himba people.\n",

      "20/ Architecture and nature in Vietnam\n",
      "Vietnam is an incredible destination for travel photography – from cities to ancient temples and stunning natural beauty, this Southeast Asian country has something for everyone.\n",
      "For wonderful cityscapes, head to Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi, where modern skyscrapers and colonial buildings are the perfect juxtaposition against the bustling markets and thousands of scooters zooming through the city streets.\n",
      "If you’re looking for a smaller city with interesting street photography, the small city of Hoi An is worth a stop, with its famous yellow-walled Old Quarter, the nightly releasing of floating lanterns down its river, and the fascinating intersection of Chinese and French architecture.\n",
      "Are you seeking more natural beauty? Consider Ha Long Bay, where dramatic limestone casts tower over the turquoise Gulf of Tonkin, or Sa Pa, a town to Vietnam’s northwest that’s comprised of impossibly green rice terraces as far as the eye can see.\n",
      "If you’re looking for something slightly less touristy than Ha Long, check out Ninh Binh, which offers similar landscapes, with limestone monoliths topped with lush greenery – but this time, the mountains are land-bound and carved out with mysterious caves.\n",

      "Often portrayed negatively by the media, Iran is a welcoming country rich with culture, history, and the most breathtaking mosques. It is also incredibly safe to travel to and to wander around with your camera.\n",
      "Start your Iran photography trip in Shiraz, home to the mesmerizing Nasir-ol-Molk Mosque. Get there early in the morning, right when it opens, to secure the best photo spot (it can get very crowded and competitive!). Then, as you watch the sun rise, the colors of the mosque’s stained glass windows begin reflecting on the carpet, creating a rainbow light show.\n",
      "Another incredible place for architectural photography in Iran is the city of Isfahan, home to the magnificent Naqsh-e Jahan Square. This square is filled with history, and is framed by two incredibly gorgeous mosques: Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque and Shah Mosque. The intricate mosaic tiles inside these mosques are simply unbelievable, and you can easily spend hours photographing them from different angles.\n",
      "To get the best architecture shots in Iran, shoot at sunrise or very early in the morning for the best lighting and the least amount of tourists. Keep in mind that the architecture in Iran is also very majestic, so having adequate gear, such as some solid wide-angle lenses for the Sony a7III , would really help capture the scale of the mosques. Be sure to also bring some wide-aperture lenses as some of the mosques are pretty dimly lit.\n",

      "Iran is an often-overlooked place to travel for photographers\n",
      "22/ Ancient and modern life in Jordan\n",
      "There are quite a few places in Jordan that are perfect for travel photography, irrespective of the type of photography you like.\n",
      "Areas like the world-famous Petra and the Dana Biosphere are fantastic for landscape photography. Meanwhile Wadi Rum should be included in your  Jordan itinerary  as it’s one of those rare places where you can see the Milky Way clearly, making it unmissable for night photography in Jordan.\n",
      "If you like murals, food photography, portraits and street photography, head to Amman. Most of the locals are accommodating and let you click pictures if you ask politely. While there aren’t specific street photography tours conducted in Amman, the Downtown area is where you’ll find more of the historical and cultural aspects of the capital.\n",
      "good places for photography\n",
      "You can take pictures at places like the Dead Sea; however, make sure you don’t let a single drop of water touch the camera as it is super salty!\n",
      "The best time to visit Jordan is in spring and autumn when it isn’t too hot or too cold as it does tend to get quite cold in winter.\n",

      "23/ The grandeur of the USA’s National Parks\n",
      "The USA’s famous National Parks are full of opportunities to photograph wildlife, natural wonders, and beautiful landscapes. Two of the most popular – and with good reason – are Yellowstone and Yosemite, both of which are fantastic destinations for travel photography.\n",
      "There are endless  things to do in Yellowstone , but if you’re a photographer, probably the only thing you’re going to want to do is take pictures! But you’ll need to get up early – the morning light makes for beautiful images and if wildlife photography is your thing, you’ll also find that the animals tend to be most active early in the day. Lamar Valley is a popular place to see wildlife.\n",
      "For iconic landscape photography spots, head to Grand Prismatic Overlook, Old Faithful, Artist Point, and Mammoth Hot Springs.\n",
      "If you’re heading to Yosemite National Park, the best time to go is in the spring. The waterfalls have a large volume because of snowmelt and the dogwoods are in bloom.\n",
      "Head to the Tunnel View lookout around sunset for one of Yosemite’s most celebrated views, or try Glacier Point, Three Brothers, Half Dome, and Yosemite Falls for more good places for photography.\n",

      "Home to colourful streets, beautiful monuments, and incredible natural scenery, India is a diverse country with plenty under its belt. Whether you like photographing architecture, wildlife, or portraits of Indians , there is something to interest any visiting photographer here.\n",
      "If you are planning to travel to India for the first time, then make sure to spend some days exploring the princely state of Rajasthan. Steeped in royal history, this region of India boasts numerous palaces, forts, and temples. You can fly into the Instagram-famous  pink city of Jaipur  and travel to Jodhpur and Udaipur before making your way to the Thar Desert in Jaisalmer. The Ranthambore National Park in Sawai Madhopur is also a must for tiger safaris during the winter season.\n",
      "Read more: Taking The Sleeper Train In India: What’s It Really Like?\n",
      "Just keep in mind that some religious places like temples and cenotaphs may not allow photography. It is best to ask a caretaker if unsure or wait for the prayers to finish. Another thing to note is that tripods are generally not allowed in most touristy places in India.\n",
      "Alternatively, for greener landscapes, check out Kerala in the south. The hill station of Munnar is widely famous for its acres of tea plantations and is one of the best places to photograph in India.\n",
      "You can spend a couple of days there and then head back down to experience the houseboats sailing on the backwaters of Kerala. If possible, opt to stay in one for a night or two and click away as you catch panoramas of palm trees and water lilies while onboard. It is particularly magical at sunrise and sunset.\n",

      "A  road trip to Alaska  should be a bucket list place to travel for photographers. The last frontier State is huge, and its wild beauty so unique and mind-blowing, that it offers plenty to see and discover.\n",
      "Alaska is a real playground for travel photographers, with history, breathtaking icy landscapes, abundant wildlife, stunning hiking trails, and some of the most scenic roads in the United States, even in the world! If you are into wildlife photography , Alaska also offers plenty of opportunities, with whales, bears, and hundreds of species of birds.\n",
      "Head to Seward, where you can take a boat tour and photograph icebergs and wildlife such as seals and whales. Or try Denali National Park, a world-class setting for wildlife photography enthusiasts.\n",
      "But the most spectacular treat that Alaska offers to any travel photographer is the opportunity to capture the Northern Lights . Fairbanks is one of the best places to see the Aurora Borealis in the world, because of its location and lack of light pollution. If you haven’t photographed the lights before, a Fairbanks northern lights tour is a great way to maximise your chances of seeing them, as the local guide will be able to plan the best time and location for epic Aurora images.\n",

      "Cultural Experiences in Japan\n",
      "Japan has a rich cultural heritage and you can discover more about it through a range of cultural experiences\n",
      "Much of traditional Japanese culture is accessible to all visitors, even those with little to no knowledge of Japanese. Traditional Japanese flower arranging, trying on kimono and taking part in ancient ceremonies are all great ways of learning more about Japan's diverse culture and picking up new skills.\n",
      "Stay the Japanese way in a traditional ryokan\n",
      "Traditional stays\n",
      "Ryokan are Japanese inns and are found across the country. These traditional-style hotels offer visitors a taste of world-renowned Japanese hospitality in an authentic setting. Futons are laid out in tatami rooms for you to sleep on, and you are likely to find public and private natural hot springs on the premises. Most ryokans provide Japanese meals for customers, and they are sometimes brought to you in your room. Prices can be expensive, but staying at a ryokan offers you deeper insight into Japanese culture and a more memorable stay.\n",
      "Learn the basics at a Japanese tea ceremony\n",
      "Brew up a rich history\n",
      "The Japanese tea ceremony is testament to the country's love of ritual and attention to detail. This ancient tradition has existed for as long as matcha has been present across the archipelago. Buddhism profoundly influenced it, and you can recognize its religious connections in the elaborate ritual that's so involved it takes practitioners years to hone their skills. There are entry-level classes in all of Japan's major cities.\n",
      "Live like a monk with a shukubo temple experience\n",
      "Live a monastic life\n",
      "Discover more about Buddhism through immersion. Shukubo are Japanese temple stays, allowing you to spend a night or more among Buddhist monks, taking part in the same daily activities and eating the same food they do. One famous spot in Japan to do this is Koyasan in Wakayama Prefecture. Many temples in the area offer visitors shukubo, and the experience can be found in other parts of the country too. Its popularity with international tourists means many temples offer English information online.\n",
      "Geisha are a strong representation of Japanese cultural heritage\n",
      "Performances from the past\n",
      "Few sights inspire images of traditional Japan like that of geisha. The white makeup and kimono of these entertainers have been a staple of Japanese life from the 18th century. Today, as a means to preserve tradition, geisha can still be found in select parts of the country. Many geisha live and train in geisha houses in Kyoto, and you can sometimes spot geisha in the street. Alternatively, you can arrange to meet them via various agencies.\n",
      "Big bodies collide in an ancient sport\n",
      "Japan's national sport\n",
      "Sumo dates back more than 1,500 years and remains a very popular sport in Japan. What started as a Shinto ritual gradually became a competitive sport, with sumo wrestlers attempting to push each other out of a ring, known as a dohyo. Six major tournaments are held annually in various cities across Japan to determine the top competitors in the field. Regional tours are made across the country.\n",
      "Get involved in one of the many matsuri—Japanese festivals\n",
      "Local festivals\n",
      "Matsuri is the Japanese word for a festival, and there are plenty to take part in. Each one is different, but you are sure to find many food stalls, people sporting traditional dress, dances, and marches through the streets. Some of the highlights in the matsuri calendar include summer matsuri with fireworks, the massive Gion Matsuri in Kyoto in July, and the Snow Festival in Sapporo every February, featuring large snow sculptures.\n",
      "Arrange flowers the ikebana way\n",
      "Flower arrangement\n",
      "Ikebana is the art of Japanese flower arranging. It originated thousands of years ago and was initially tied to Shintoism. Ikebana is distinct from other flower arranging styles, favoring simplicity and minimalism. It takes a long time to understand what every flower means within ikebana, but even those visiting the country can get a basic understanding by attending a beginner's class, which you can find in most major cities.\n",
      "The beat of the taiko drum has resounded through Japanese history\n",
      "The big beat\n",
      "Taiko is a type of Japanese drum that has been used for centuries. Historically it's associated with private court shows and warfare, but nowadays it's played in musical performances and during festivals. Taiko can also refer to a performance centered around the instrument. Groups of people get together and beat rhythmically on taiko drums. You can watch these performances at matsuri across the country but, to understand taiko drums more, take a beginner's class.\n",
      "A slice of Japanese cuisine\n",
      "Discover Japanese cuisine\n",
      "Sushi is Japanese cuisine that is celebrated internationally. It evolved from humble street food in the 1800s and can now be found everywhere from convenience stores to the most prestigious restaurants. Sushi-making classes are easy to find, particularly near fish markets. These classes offer great insight into Japanese culture and add a new skill to your cooking repertoire.\n",
      "The elegant Japanese kimono\n",
      "A tradition you can wear\n",
      "Kimono used to be the everyday dress for women across the country, but today it's often only worn for special occasions, like weddings or funerals. Yukata are slightly lighter, and both men and women wear them. You'll see them worn during summer festivals as casual wear. Kimono and yukata are both possible to rent. Wear one around the town or city for a few hours and get a sense for Japan's traditional sartorial style. The latest information may differ, so please check the official website.\n",

The 15 Best Ryokans to Stay in When Visiting Japan The baths at Gora Kadan look like works of art | Courtesy of Gora Kadan / Expedia Hannah Sender 27 September 2024 Copy Link Facebook Email Twitter Pinterest Recommended by See & Do 10 of the Oldest Cities in the World See & Do The Best Places for an Asian Spring Break For an authentic experience in Japan , why not opt for a stay in a traditional ryokan? These highway rest stops originated in the Edo period, from the 17th to the 19th century – here’s our pick of the best villas in Japan. Make the most of your time in Japan and create unforgettable memories with the many bookable guided tours here . Traditionally built from wood and featuring tatami-mat flooring, communal bathing and dining areas, ryokans – traditional Japanese cottages – maintain their popularity among the Japanese and foreign travellers. They are expensive compared to the capsule hotels of Tokyo and chain inns, but you can’t put a price on experiencing tradition in the Land of the Rising Sun. Gora Kadan Independent Hotel Courtesy of Gora Kadan / Expedia Built on the grounds of an Imperial Family member’s former summer villa, Gora Kadan is an accommodation imbued with an essence of upmarket luxury. The ryokan sits in the lush hills of hot-spring-dotted Hakone, a popular weekend destination from Tokyo. Renovated to a standard that would make the Imperial Family proud, this Japanese hotel features conceptual indoor-outdoor spaces, baths that resemble contemporary art pieces and traditional Japanese flourishes. Nishimuraya Honkan Ryokan Courtesy of Nishimuraya Honkan / Expedia With 150-plus years of history and a style that’s nothing short of timeless, Nishimuraya Honkan is a luxurious ryokan in the onsen (hot-spring) town of Kinosaki, in the volcanic mountains of Hyōgo Prefecture. Nishimuraya Honkan fits right into this traditional landscape. With a lush strolling garden and authentically styled rooms combining Japanese elegance with contemporary luxury, it’s the right balance of sophistication and relaxation. Wanosato Ryokan Courtesy of Wanosato / Expedia The Hida-Takayama region of Gifu Prefecture is best known for the gassho-zukuri (thatched-roof houses) and minka (traditional rural dwellings) that dot the mountainous landscape. Wanosato is a renovated minka – a mystical place with a 160-year-old history. However, it has been reborn to be less of a common home and more of a luxury Japanese guest house. With mountain views, sansai (mountain vegetables), wasakana (river fish) and wagyu-level-delicious Hida beef, it’s a side of regional Japan in which to indulge. Become a Culture Tripper!

Miyama Sansou Ryokan Courtesy of Miyama Sansou / Booking.com You’ll find Miyama Sansou in a valley surrounded by towering hot-spring-filled mountains, deep in regional Kumamoto. Comprising a small cluster of villa-type homes, this impressively contemporary version of a ryokan promises Japanese-style luxury. Plenty of hot-spring baths and incredible cuisine in a secluded piece of land create the ultimate escape. Konansou Ryokan Courtesy of Konansou / Expedia The area known as Fuji Five Lakes has long been a retreat favoured by those looking to wash off the stresses of city life. It’s home to the Fuji Kawaguchiko Onsen, where you’ll find Konansou – a lush ryokan at the base of Mount Fuji with traditional-modern rooms, outdoor baths with mountain and lake views, and fresh seasonal cuisine served daily in the restaurant or your room. Takaragawa Onsen Osenkaku Ryokan Courtesy of Takaragawa Onsen Osenkaku / Expedia With the largest outdoor bath in Japan, Takaragawa Onsen Osenkaku is a haven for the most serious of soakers. It sits in the Minakami Onsen area, in the rugged landscape of Gunma Prefecture. Classic facilities at this Japanese villa are split across three buildings – the Main Hall, East Building and #1 Annex Building – each decorated slightly differently, showcasing this secluded retreat’s uniqueness and style. Zaborin Ryokan, Luxury Courtesy of Zaborin / Expedia Hokkaido’s snow-capped mountains are home to Zaborin, one of the most enthralling ryokans in Japan, with a modern display of artful architecture. It comprises 15 villas that blend rustic country-home style with contemporary flourishes and a sense of Japanese essentialism. Each room features an indoor and outdoor onsen bath, filled with pure volcanic water topped with sprawling country views. Sumiyoshi Ryokan Independent Hotel Courtesy of Sumiyoshi Ryokan / Expedia Sumiyoshi Ryokan lies in the mountainous region of Takayama in Gifu Prefecture, on the idyllic Miyagawa River. With rooms overlooking the river or the Sumiyoshi gardens, you won’t find a better place to unwind. The owners of this guest house in Japan have maintained the architecture and style of the Taishō-era building while decorating it with ornaments from the period. You can enjoy traditional Japanese cuisine in your room, and the staff will happily answer any questions about what to eat (or how to eat it). Tokyo Ryokan Independent Hotel While Tokyo Ryokan has maintained a traditional stance on communal bathrooms, the property is small, with only three rooms, and all facilities are kept to the highest standards of cleanliness. With respect to conventional Japanese living, the ryokan will encourage you to make yourself at home. The most outstanding feature of this traditional inn is the interior, complete with paper walls and doors and minimal decoration. The staff run the property according to fundamental Buddhist principles. Eko-in Independent Hotel Courtesy of Eko-in / Hotels.com Eko-in is a remarkable place to spend the night, situated in a 1,000-year-old Buddhist temple. You’ll get to stay in a Japanese-style room while using communal facilities. One room has a private onsen , but all have views of the inner garden. As you might expect, you’re welcome to join temple practices, including using the Ajikan Practice Hall for meditation, attending morning services and joining a Goma fire ritual. Lessons in Buddhist sutra writing are also on offer. More conventional recreation includes the use of the public onsen (divided by gender), while the cuisine is traditional Japanese vegetarian, which you can eat in your room. Ryokan Sanga Independent Hotel Courtesy of Ryokan Sanga / Expedia In Kumamoto Onsen town in Kyushu, Ryokan Sanga offers an escape from busy city life and is remarkable for its setting alone. It highlights natural materials, and Mount Aso sits overhead instead of flashing neon signs. Also, taxis and public buses are the only means of accessing this remote location. A world apart from the Tokyo-based ryokans, this one offers you the chance to bathe in onsens , including public outdoor baths, public gender-specific indoor baths and private baths. There’s a variety of rooms; the more expensive options include ensuites and larger living spaces. Shimizu Independent Hotel, Ryokan Courtesy of Shimizu / Expedia Kyoto-based Shimizu has nine private rooms – each with a shower and toilet – and maintains a sense of calm from the bustling streets without feeling completely remote. There are several baths, some private, including a Japanese lime bath and a hot-spring bath. You can dine on traditional vegetarian meals in your room, take part in evening activities, such as calligraphy classes, and rent bicycles for use around the city. Ryokan Fujioto Independent Hotel In historic Tsumago – a well-preserved postal town in the Kiso Valley – Ryokan Fujioto is a minshuku (a budget ryokan ) surrounded by a private garden. Traffic is virtually non-existent here as cars are prohibited on the main street during the day. The inn’s owners provide traditional Japanese meals (serving as many as seven courses), yukata to wear while dining and Japanese footwear, which you can wear around town. It also has a traditional Hinoki bath, run with scented Kiso Valley cypress wood. Although Fujioto is not as grand or as large as some of the other ryokans on this list, this family-oriented space has a comforting characteristic often lacking in the more popular ones. Iwaso Inn Independent Hotel Courtesy of Iwaso Inn / Hotels.com On the island of Miyajima (also known as Itsukushima), Iwaso Inn is a luxurious ryokan with a long history. It opened in 1854 and provided shelter throughout the Meiji period, after which it became a modern Japanese hotel. It’s close to Hiroshima but has a much sought-after distance from the popular tourist destination. It comprises four cottages and two other buildings housing rooms; some accommodation options have private onsens and toilets. There are also two large, outdoor communal baths sheltered from the elements. Yutouya Ryokan Independent Hotel Courtesy of Yutouya Ryokan / Hotels.com Founded in 1688 in Kinosaki Onsen – a hot-spring town in Hyōgo Prefecture – Yutouya Ryokan is popular with Japanese creatives. Its rooms feature a private bath and toilet or a private toilet only. It also has an indoor bath and a family bath outside. Although you’ll want to visit the local restaurants to try Kinosaki Onsen’s famed seafood (the crab is especially good), the ryokan ’s menu is something to write home about, offering seafood alongside delicacies such as wagyu beef.
